This webpage was created using HTML5 and CSS.  It is made up of three HTML files and one CSS file.  Each HTML file serves a different purpose.  The home screen of the page is saved under 'index.html'.  On this page, you can use the links at the bottom of the screen to navigate to the other pages, where my resume and a short biography are coded in HTML.  The one CSS file is there to style the HTML webpage.  I used things like font-weight, borders, font-color, text-align, etc.  The CSS file gives a little life to the webpage and makes it less dull.
