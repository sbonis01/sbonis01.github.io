<h1>Biography of Stephen Bonish</h1>
<p>I grew up in Wilmington, MA with my family of 5.  It was my two older brothers and my mother and father.  I grew up playing and watching sports.  I played everything, from football to basketball to baseball and even golf.  When I was in 5th grade, I received my dog as a birthday present.  He is a miniature shnauzer named Spyro.  In 2017, I graduated from Wilmington High School and I now attend Tufts University with a major in Computer Science.</p>
